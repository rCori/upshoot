Up Shoot (working title)
A simple action game targeted towards mobile made with libGDX.
Using Eclipse and libGDX.
I plan to submit this for a Game Jam so some branches may include things like
screenshots, game description, instructions, etc.

I read this tutorial series:
http://obviam.net/index.php/getting-started-in-android-game-development-with-libgdx-create-a-working-prototype-in-a-day-tutorial-part-1/

so any similar looking code, credit goes to them.
